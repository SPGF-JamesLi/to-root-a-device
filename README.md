# to-root-a-device
This is the first big projecct by SPGF platform, this may use a long time with a lot of peole help
IT seems like a lot of phone such as vivo, HuaWei, oppo cannot root, so we are tring to find a way to root those devices.
For root, their is some thing that we must know that is the root is the most important user in linux system,so that the system must use the root to do a lot of things, we need to found a bug that we can get the root to DATA or system. Then we can use a APP to get it, so we can get the root.
